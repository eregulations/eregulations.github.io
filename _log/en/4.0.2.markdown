# v 4.0.2   <small>13/12/2016</small>

<p class="alert alert-warning">This update is a batch about simplifying how the costs are managed on the administrative interface and the removal of buttons that are never used.</p>

<ul class="list-view">

  <li>
    <h5>No more "This step is subjected to a cost"</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Costs</p>
    <p>There is no need to specify if there is a cost, the “This step is subjected to costs” setting has been removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Cost type selector to chose between fixed, % and 'per'</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Costs</p>
    <p>Before, the types of costs (fixed, percentage, per) were not clear. With this update, there is now a costs type selector before the costs fields. </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Adding a variable of a cost directly from the cost settings</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Costs</p>
    <p>The variable of a cost can be added simply by typing it in the Variable field of the cost setting.</p>

    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Documents</p>
    <p>The “Select from FTP” has been removed. No one uses it and it is not necessary anymore as the system is fast.</p>
  </li>

    <h5>No more "Description" field for each document</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Documents</p>
    <p>The field “Description” of each requirement, result, law, has been removed. The field was never used.</p>

    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Documents</p>
    <p>The checkbox “Has document attached” of each requirement, result, law, has been removed. The checkbox was never used, it had no effect.</p>
