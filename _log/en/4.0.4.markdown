<p class="alert alert-warning">This update is about simplifying the way results of steps are used as requirements in other steps.</p>

<ul class="list-view">

  <li>
    <h5>Results come from the document database</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Results</p>
	<p>Before, results are created from the step itself. With this update, result is added to the step from the “documents database”.</p>
	<p>If the result does not exist in the “documents database” it is created in the database and then added to the step - exactly as the requirements work.</p>

  <li>
    <h5>Relation between results and requirement is automatic</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Results & Requirements</p>
    <p>Before, the requirements that were results from a previous step were added from the list of documents, where they appeared with a yellow background.</p>

    <p>With this update, requirements are documents coming from the database of documents. A requirement can be a result from a previous step or not, it does not matter. All the requirements are added from the database of documents.<br>The system detects automatically if one document appear to be result in one step and requirement in a posterior step (in this case it will be green in the summary).</p>
  </li>

</ul>
