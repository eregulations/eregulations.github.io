# v 4.1   <small>Not yet applied</small>

<p class="alert alert-warning">This update is a batch of fast simplifications of the administrative interface.</p>

<ul class="list-view">

  <li>
    <h5>Results come from the document database</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Results</p>
	<p>Before, results are created from the step itself. With this update, result is added to the step from the “documents database”.</p>
	<p>If the result does not exist in the “documents database” it is created in the database and then added to the step - exactly as the requirements work.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>Relation between results and requirement is automatic</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Results & Requirements</p>
    <p>Before, the requirements that were results from a previous step were added from the list of documents, where they appeared with a yellow background.</p>

    <p>With this update, requirements are documents coming from the database of documents. A requirement can be a result from a previous step or not, it does not matter. All the requirements are added from the database of documents.<br>The system detects automatically if one document appear to be result in one step and requirement in a posterior step (in this case it will be green in the summary).</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>Recourses are treated as contacts</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Recourses</p>
    <p>Before, the recourses were created outside the step and then “called” inside the step to link them. There was a button “Add recourse” on the top of the procedures tree.</p>
    <p>With this update, the recourse is created in the “Recourse” tab of the step, exactly as we create the contact in the “Contact” tab. The button “Add recourse” on the top of the procedures tree has disappeared.</p>
  </li>  
  <li>
    <h5>No more "Show recourses" on top of the procedures tree</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Recourses</p>
    <p>This selector was not needed anymore with the update of the recourses "treated as contacts" - it has been removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>No more "This step is subjected to a cost"</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Costs</p>
    <p>There is no need to specify if there is a cost, the “This step is subjected to costs” setting has been removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Cost type selector to chose between fixed, % and 'per'</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Costs</p>
    <p>Before, the types of costs (fixed, percentage, per) were not clear. With this update, there is now a costs type selector before the costs fields. </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Adding a variable of a cost directly from the cost settings</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Costs</p>
    <p>The variable of a cost can be added simply by typing it in the Variable field of the cost setting.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>No more "Upload from FTP" button for uploading medias</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Documents</p>
    <p>The “Select from FTP” has been removed. No one uses it and it is not necessary anymore as the system is fast.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>No more "Description" field for each document</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Documents</p>
    <p>The field “Description” of each requirement, result, law, has been removed. The field was never used.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>No more "Has document attached" checkbox for each document</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Documents</p>
    <p>The checkbox “Has document attached” of each requirement, result, law, has been removed. The checkbox was never used, it had no effect.</p>
  </li>

</ul>
