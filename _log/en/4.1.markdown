<p class="alert alert-warning">This update is a simplification of the use of recourses in the system.</p>
<ul class="list-view">
  <li>
    <h5>Recourses are treated as contacts</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Recourses</p>
    <p>Before, the recourses were created outside the step and then “called” inside the step to link them. There was a button “Add recourse” on the top of the procedures tree.</p>
    <p>With this update, the recourse is created in the “Recourse” tab of the step, exactly as we create the contact in the “Contact” tab. The button “Add recourse” on the top of the procedures tree has disappeared.</p>
  </li>  
  <li>
    <h5>No more "Show recourses" on top of the procedures tree</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Recourses</p>
    <p>This selector was not needed anymore with the update of the recourses "treated as contacts" - it has been removed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
