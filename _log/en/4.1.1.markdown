    <h5>Change directories elements visibility from public page</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Public interface | Directories | Visibility</p>
	<p>In the directory, the visibility of the elements (entities, units, persons, documents, laws) was only configurable from the administrative interface. Now, when logged on the public interface (as for the consistency review), there is an eye icon for each element. Clicking on this eye icon toggles the visibility of the element from a normal user visiting the system. This helps to clean the directories.</p>

  <li>
    <h5>Timeframe : half-day shown as "0.5 day"</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Step | Timeframe</p>
    <p>Before, a duration of half-day was shown as "1/2 day" on the public interface. This was misleading to the visitors. We have changed it to "0.5 day".</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h5>Safe empty recycle bin</h5>
    <p class="meta-data">Admin interface | Procedure tree | Recycle bin</p>
    <p>When emptying the recycle bin, the eventual step that are still published online will not be deleted.</p>
  </li>
